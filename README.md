Linear Regression Predictive Model for Life Expectancy

This project was an exercise in linear regression. The brief was to create a model that trains on historical life expectancy statistics from countries all over the world by the World Health Organization, and then able to predict life expectancy. The deliverables were:
- An elaborate model, one that takes more data where there is no issue providing it due to sensitivity around the data. This model is expected to deliver more accurate results.
- A second 'ethical' model that can provide less accurate results based on less data for scenarios where there might be ethical issues with providing the complete data or in case not all required data can be made available.
- An interface that allows the user to choose which of the two models they would like to use, take the user's input and provides a prediction based on the input.

This was an interesting project that faced us with several challenges and required our decisions around:
- Dealing with missing data?
- Ethical concerns regarding privacy and bias
- Identifying the data that provides signal and reducing the noise
- Scaling the data
- Evaluating results and choosing the best model
- Identifying minimal data that provides enough signal for the 'ethical' model, and delivers reasonably compromised results
- Managing and validating user input for both models
